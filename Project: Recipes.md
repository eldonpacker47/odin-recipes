Project: Recipes

Create a recipe website that consits of a main index (homepage) that last links to a number of recipes.

This website will have a number of webpages: a homepage (index.html), links <a> </a> to different webpages on the website. This allows the user to navigate from the homepage to different recipes held on seperate webpages within the website. 

I'm using HTML to code the main pieces of each webpage contained on the website

This project shows I have skills in writting webpages in HTML. I used the terminal to create directories and files to make up the website. Within the webpages I demonstrate use of links, headers, paragraphs, italics, and how to structure a homepage.
