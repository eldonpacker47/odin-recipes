Project: Recipes
Create a recipe website that consists of a main index (homepage) that links to a number of recipes.

This Website will have a number of webpages: a homepage (index.html), links <a></a> to a different webpage on the website. This allows the user to navigate from the homepage to different recipes held on seperate web pages within the website.

Using HTML to code the "bones" of each webpage contained on the website.

This project shows I have skills in writing webpages in HTML. I used the terminal to create directories and files to make up the website. Within the webpages I demonstrate use of links, headers, paragraphs, italics, and how to structure a homepage.
